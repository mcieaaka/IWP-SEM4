        My Neighbour is so lazy. I have often seen random kids steal fruits from his garden and he sits right there and does nothing. Later, he cries in every public gathering that the kids stole his food. I feel the irony, he can stop the kids right infront of his eyes but istead he chooses to cry about it.
